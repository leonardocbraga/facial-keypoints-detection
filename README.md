# facial-keypoints-detection

This project refers to the [Kaggle competition] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection/) to detect the location of keypoints on face images using python. It consists of files to fit the training data, load data from training and test set, predict an outcome given an input X and generate the submission file. Also, there is a file to test predictions on some examples of test set.

The linear model used to fit the data was Ridge regression of scikit-learn package and part of the solution was provided by the Daniel Nouri's tutorial.
